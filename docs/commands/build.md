# Build

*Build a local development version of a Lightning App*

```bash
lng build
```

> Run this command from the root folder of your Lightning App.

You can use the `lng build` command to build a version of your App for *local* development.

The built App is placed in the **build** folder which is located in the folder of your App.

> In older versions of the Lightning CLI (older than version 1.6.0), the build command placed the built App in the **dist** folder.

The App version that is generated by the `lng build` command, is intended to simulate the Metrological Application Platform during *local* development.
For example, it loads the appBundle asynchronously and makes an API request to **settings.json** (which is used for App configuration), similar to the boot process of the Metrological Application Platform.

If you want to use your App *outside* the context of the Metrological Application Platform, you might also be interested in the [`lng dist`](dist.md) command.
