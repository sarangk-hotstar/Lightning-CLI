# Docs

*Open the Lightning SDK documentation*

```bash
lng docs
```

> Run this command from the root folder of your Lightning App.

You can use the `lng docs` command if you need to review the *Lightning SDK* documentation for the App that you are currently developing.

It is important to realize that the *Lightning SDK* documentation is *version controlled*. The `lng docs` command will open
a local webserver that displays the documentation matching the *exact* SDK version that your App is using.
