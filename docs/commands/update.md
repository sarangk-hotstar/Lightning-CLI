# Update

*Update the Lightning CLI to the latest version*

```bash
lng update
```

The Lightning CLI has an *auto-update* mechanism. It checks periodically if you are still using the latest version and, if you are not, updates automatically. An auto update is triggered by a new version of the CLI being released (which can be related to a change on the SDK side or the Metrological Dashboard). This mechanism ensures that you are always compatible with the latest changes.

If you want to manually *force* an update to the latest version, use the `lng update` command.
