# Serve

*Start a local webserver and run a built Lightning App in a web browser*

```bash
lng serve
```

> Run this command from the root folder of your Lightning App.

The `lng serve` command starts a local webserver and runs an App (that was built with the `lng build` command) from the **build** folder.

By default, the local webserver launches at the next available port –starting at 8080– and opens your App in a new browser window.
