# Create

*Create a new Lightning App*

```bash
lng create
```

The `lng create` command helps you to quickly kick start a new App.

An interactive prompt takes you through a series of steps and choices.

Based on your input, it generates a complete *blueprint* App with the appropriate file and folder structure as required by the Lightning SDK.

You can use the generated blueprint App and files / folder structure as a starting point for the development of a new Lightning App.
