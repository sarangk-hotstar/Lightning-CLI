# Lightning CLI

The Lightning-CLI is the _Command Line Interface_ tool for a seamless Lightning App Development flow.
Although it's primarily intended as a _client side_ developer tool, it can also be used _server side_.

With the Lightning-CLI you can easily _create_ and _build_ Lightning Apps.
It's also the standard way to _upload_ Lightning Apps to the Metrological AppStore.

The Lightning-CLI goes hand in hand with the [Lightning-SDK](https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-SDK).
