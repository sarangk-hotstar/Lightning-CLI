# Install the Lightning CLI

The easiest way to get up and running with a Lightning App is by installing the *Lightning CLI* globally on your system.

> You can find the Lightning CLI repository here: [https://github.com/rdkcentral/LightningCLI/.](https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-SDK/)

The Lightning CLI provides a set of development tools that enable you to do the following:

* Quickly create a new *blueprint* for a Lightning App
* Build and run Lightning Apps in your browser
* Deploy a new release of your App to the Metrological Dashboard

> Make sure you are using the *latest* Lightning CLI version. See the [Lightning Release Info](http://www.lightningjs.io/announcements/carbon-release) for more information.

Perform the following steps to install the Lightning CLI on your system:

1. Run the command `npm install -g @lightningjs/cli` in your command prompt.
2. Check if the installation was successful by running `lng -V`. This should display the version of the Lightning CLI you have installed.
3. If the Lightning CLI is installed successfully, you can use  it anywhere on your machine using the `lng` command.

> See [Commands](../../F_CLIRef/Commands/index.md) in the [Lightning CLI Reference Documentation](../../F_CLIRef/index.md) for a description of the available Lightning CLI commands and options.
